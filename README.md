# Cura

**A Privacy-Focused Medical History Management App**

Cura scans your lab reports, prescriptions, bills and discharge summaries, reads them
on the device, files them automatically, and lets you ask questions about your own
records in plain language.

No account. No server. No telemetry. By default, nothing leaves your phone.

## What Cura is

Most people keep medical documents as a pile of paper, a folder of photos, or a
forgotten email attachment. When you actually need something ("what was my
hemoglobin last time", "how much did that surgery cost", "when was that scan"), it is
almost impossible to find.

Cura turns that pile into something you can search and question, without handing your
medical history to anyone.

**What it does**

- Reads a document with the camera or imports a PDF you already have.
- Pulls out the title, type, date and results table automatically.
- Flags a lab value as High or Low against the range printed on the page.
- Files it into a searchable library and a chronological timeline.
- Rewrites a scraped report summary into plain prose in the background, after saving.
- Sets medicine reminders from a scanned prescription, reading the dose times off the
  printed directions.
- Charts the same test across reports once it appears in two or more of them.
- Answers questions about your records, showing a card for every report an answer
  names and marking which model replied. Stop an answer mid-sentence, or long press
  your last question to copy or re-ask it.
- Exports any record, or your whole library, back out as a PDF.

**What it is for**

Keeping your own medical history in one place, understanding what a report says, and
finding a value or a date quickly. It is a personal organizer for documents you
already own.

**What it is not**

Cura is not a doctor. It does not diagnose, and it does not give medical advice. It
explains and organizes documents you already have.

## Install

Download the APK from the [Releases](../../releases) page.

**What you need**

| | |
|---|---|
| Android version | 8.0 (Oreo) or newer |
| Download | about 61 MB |
| Free space | about 2 GB, since the AI model is fetched separately on first run |

Cura is not on the Play Store, so Android will ask permission before installing a file
from outside it. That prompt is normal for any APK.

1. Open the downloaded `.apk` from your notifications or Files app.
2. Android says installing from this source is blocked. Tap **Settings**, turn on
   **Allow from this source**, then go back.
3. Tap **Install**, then **Open**.

Setup then walks you through choosing where the AI runs, optional voice input, and an
optional app lock. Every step can be skipped.

<details>
<summary><b>Optional: check the download is genuine</b></summary>

<br>

Every release is signed with the same key, so you can confirm a file really came from
here and was not modified. Run this on the downloaded APK:

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs Cura.apk
```

The SHA-256 it prints must be:

```
a7:de:64:b0:a4:45:44:f4:a3:16:5f:80:58:17:16:83:8d:b6:2c:d3:f9:d4:70:e9:bb:48:75:44:26:6c:97:53
```

If it does not match, the file was signed by someone else. Do not install it.

## How scanning works, and why you must review it

This is the most important thing to understand about Cura.

**Values are read off the page, never written by a model.** OCR recognizes the text
on the page, and the results table is rebuilt from the *geometry* of that text, which
number sits in which row and which column. Titles, document types and dates are
decided by rules. Amounts on bills come from the same geometry.

On a lab report where that geometry clearly came up short, an AI model gets one narrow
job: point at the rows that were skipped. It never supplies the numbers. Every label
and every digit it hands back has to already appear in the recognized text or the row
is thrown away, and a row the geometry already read is never overwritten.

The upside is that a value in Cura is a value literally printed on your report. It
cannot be invented, because nothing is generating it.

**Out of range values are flagged the same way.** A High or Low badge is computed
from the reference range printed beside the value, not from any general medical
knowledge. A value sitting exactly on a boundary stays in range. If the lab printed
its own arrow and that arrow disagrees with the arithmetic, Cura shows no badge at
all rather than a confident wrong one, because no flag beats a wrong flag. Edit a
value on the review screen and it is re-checked immediately.

> ### Please read before you trust a scan
>
> Because the reader is geometric and rule based, it depends on the page looking like
> a normal document. **Unusual, cramped, skewed, handwritten or multi column layouts
> can produce missing values, values attached to the wrong row, a wrong date, or a
> wrong title.**
>
> Cura always shows you a review screen before saving so you can fix or delete
> anything that came out wrong. **Check the values against the original document
> every time before you save.** Treat the paper report, not Cura, as the source of
> truth.

---

## Medicine reminders

Once a prescription is saved, each medicine gets a **Remind** button, and the
Medicines header gets **Remind for all**.

**The times come off the page, not from a model.** The printed directions are read
by rule, the same way the results table is:

| Printed on the prescription | Reminder times |
|---|---|
| `1-0-1` | 8:00 AM, 9:00 PM |
| `1-1-1` | 8:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 9:00 PM |
| `OD`, "once daily" | 8:00 AM |
| `BD`, "twice daily" | 8:00 AM, 9:00 PM |
| `TDS`, "thrice daily" | 8:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 9:00 PM |
| `QID` | 8:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 6:00 PM, 10:00 PM |
| `HS`, "at night" | 10:00 PM |
| `every 6 hours`, `q6h` | every 6 hours from 8:00 AM |

**An as needed medicine is never scheduled.** `SOS`, `PRN`, `stat` and "as needed"
are recognized and deliberately produce no reminder.

**How long the course runs** comes from the page too, from `x 5 days`, `for 2 weeks`
or the `5/7` shorthand. When the prescription does not say, Cura asks you once
instead of guessing, and you can override any single medicine in that same sheet.

**What it does not read.** `b/f` and `a/f`, before and after food, are not
interpreted. Only the dosing pattern sets the times, so a medicine meant for after
food will still remind you at the default hour. Adjust it if that matters.

Every time is editable, every dose has its own on/off switch, and you can delete one
medicine's doses or every reminder on a prescription. Notifications carry **Taken**
and **Snooze 15m**, medicines due at the same time arrive as one notification rather
than five, and the last day of a course gets its own notice an hour after the final
dose. The home screen carries a bell with a badge and a **Today's medicines** card
with tick offs and how far through the course you are.

**Nothing about this touches the network.** Reminders are scheduled by your phone and
delivered by your phone. There is no push service and no server. Medicine names and
dose times never leave the device. Cura asks for notification and alarm permission,
and for permission to restart after a reboot so your reminders survive one. If exact
alarms are unavailable, reminders still work, they just fire approximately.

Reminders live in the same local database as everything else. Deleting a document
deletes its reminders, wiping your data wipes them, and a course that has finished is
cleared automatically the next time you open the app.

---

## Trends

**The same test, over time.** A measure starts charting once it appears in two or
more of your reports. Bills and prescriptions are skipped, and so is any row still
flagged for review.

**Matching the same test across reports is deterministic.** Cura folds known synonyms
together, so haemoglobin, hemoglobin, Hb and Hgb are one chart, as are SGPT and ALT,
or urea and BUN. It also knows what must stay apart: fasting and postprandial glucose
are separate charts, as are direct and indirect bilirubin, because merging them would
be a lie.

**Units are compared, never converted.** If one report prints a measure in a unit
that does not match the others, that reading is dropped from the chart rather than
rescaled into place. Cura would rather show you fewer points than a converted number
it had to invent.

Seven common markers chart by default, haemoglobin, platelet count, bilirubin, SGPT,
HbA1c, glucose and CRP. Anything else that repeats is one tap away under **Track a
measure**.

The chart is drawn by the app itself, with no charting library. The shaded band is
the normal range printed on your most recent report, and a dot turns red when that
reading sits outside it. **Points are spaced evenly rather than by time**, so the gap
between two dots is not proportional to the gap between two dates. The real date is
printed under every point.

**The summary under the chart is the one place a model writes prose about your
numbers**, and it is fenced in tightly. It is handed only the measure name, the unit,
the range and the readings themselves. It never sees your report titles. Every number
it writes back has to already appear in those facts, or the whole summary is thrown
away and asked for again. A model may phrase, never renumber. The result is cached
until your readings, your engine or the prompt actually change.

If you have turned the cloud engine on, this crosses the same privacy filter as
everything else, and it fails closed: if the filter strips the request to nothing,
nothing is sent.

Under the summary, **Where these came from** lists every report the readings were
taken from, newest first. Tap one to open it.

---

## The on-device engine (default)

Everything runs locally: OCR, parsing, storage, search, and AI answers. There is no
server and no account.

**What you download.** A language model is fetched once, then never again. Three open
GGUF builds are offered, quantized Q4_K_M, all requiring no login or token:

| Model | Size |
|---|---|
| LFM2.5 1.2B Instruct | 731 MB |
| Qwen3 1.7B | 1.28 GB |
| Qwen 2.5 0.5B Instruct (lighter) | 398 MB |

Onboarding measures your phone's RAM and cores and recommends one, but the choice is
always yours. Models can be switched or deleted later in Settings. The download runs
in the background with a progress notification, and can be cancelled.

Qwen3 can reason step by step, so with it selected Ask gains a **Think harder**
toggle that gives the model a larger budget to work in. It is off by default,
because thinking costs time and most questions do not need it. The other two models
do not have it.

**Where the model actually runs.** Mostly it does not. Counts, latest values, dates
and lists are answered directly from the stored fields with no model at all, which is
why those answers are instant. The language model only runs for reasoning, summaries
and definitions.

**During scanning**, the on-device model is used for two things: on a receipt or bill
it may suggest a **title** and a **purpose note**, and on a lab report whose table
came out short it may point at the rows that were missed. Nothing else. Prescriptions,
dates and amounts stay fully deterministic, and every value it points at is checked
against the recognized text first.

**After saving**, it does one more thing. An imaging, discharge, visit or prescription
summary is scraped straight off the page, section by section, so it is accurate but
reads like a dump. Once you save the record, the model rewrites it into plain prose in
the background. Open the document before it finishes and you see the original with a
"Rewriting" note beside it. The scraped text is never overwritten: it is what Ask
searches and quotes, and the rewrite is display only, so a rewrite that drops a detail
costs you nothing. Any number in the rewrite that is not on the original page is thrown
away.

**Tradeoffs, honestly.** Answers are slower than cloud, and the speed depends entirely
on your phone. It works best on devices with 6 GB or more of RAM.

**Network use.** The one-time model download, and, only if you turn it on, a daily
check for a new version of Cura (see [Updates](#updates)). Your documents never leave
the device.

---

## The cloud model (optional, off by default)

Some phones are too slow to run a language model comfortably. For those users, Cura
can talk to any OpenAI-compatible provider using **your own API key**.

This is **off by default**, requires a one-time explicit consent, and once it is on,
the privacy text in Settings changes to say so. The app never claims to be fully
offline while it is not.

### Providers

Presets are built in for the following, and any other OpenAI-compatible endpoint can
be added with a custom base URL:

| Provider | Base URL |
|---|---|
| OpenRouter (default) | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` |
| OpenAI | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| Groq | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` |
| NVIDIA NIM | `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` |
| Custom | any OpenAI-compatible base URL |

**Free options.** You do not have to pay to use this. Several of these providers
offer free access at the time of writing: OpenRouter lists a number of free models,
and Groq and NVIDIA NIM both offer free tiers. You are billed by whichever provider
you choose, never by Cura. Cura takes no cut and has no API key of its own.

**Your key.** It is stored in encrypted storage backed by the Android Keystore, using
`flutter_secure_storage`, never in plain preferences. There is a test connection
button so you can verify a key before saving it.

### Exactly where the cloud model is used after scanning

Cloud involvement in scanning is deliberately narrow, and it never produces your
numbers.

| Document type | With cloud enabled, the model may set |
|---|---|
| Prescription | nothing, never sent, fully deterministic |
| Visit note (typed by you) | nothing, never sent, fully deterministic |
| Receipt or bill | title, purpose note |
| Lab, imaging, discharge summary | type, date, title |
| Lab report only | the results table, **and only** when the OCR geometry was ambiguous or clearly missed rows, and every value can be matched back to the OCR |
| Imaging, discharge, visit, prescription | after saving, the summary is rewritten for readability, from the scraped clinical sections only |
| A charted measure | the sentences under a trend chart, written from the measure name, unit, range and readings alone, never the report titles |

Everything else stays deterministic: prescription contents and bill amounts. Lab
values are always read off the page, never written by a model. The narrative summary
is deterministic where it counts: the scraped text is stored verbatim and is what Ask
searches and quotes. Only the copy you read on the document page is rewritten.

Even in the table cases, the answer is not trusted blindly. Every value that comes
back is re-checked against the original OCR text before it is stored, so a remote
model cannot invent, alter or round a measurement.

### What is actually sent

Before any request leaves the phone, Cura minimizes it:

1. **An allowlist filter runs first.** Only lines carrying a medical signal are kept:
   a value with a unit, a reference range, a verdict, a section heading, a procedure,
   the report title, or the report date. Everything else is dropped as a block, which
   removes the letterhead, the patient details block and the footer in one go. That is
   where names, addresses, hospital IDs and phone numbers live, so they are removed no
   matter how they happen to be worded.
2. **A second pass scrubs whatever survived**, by keyword and by structure.
3. **Questions in Ask** are sent with structured fields only, meaning the title,
   results and note. The raw OCR text of the page is never sent.
4. **A summary rewrite** sends the scraped clinical sections and nothing else. No
   question you typed, no chat history, no page text. If the filter strips it to
   nothing, the request is abandoned rather than widened.
5. **A trend summary** sends the measure name, its unit, its normal range and the
   list of readings with their dates. Not the report titles, not the page text. It
   is abandoned the same way if the filter empties it.

On-device is never redacted, because nothing leaves the phone, and your stored
documents always keep their full text.

---

## Voice input (optional)

Ask can listen instead of making you type. Cura downloads Whisper, a small open
source speech to text model, once, about 57 MB. Transcription happens on the phone,
so your audio is never uploaded, and the microphone only opens while you are actually
speaking. It can be skipped during setup and enabled later in Settings, or deleted
to reclaim the space.

## App lock (optional)

Because Cura holds your medical history, you can require a fingerprint, face unlock,
or your device PIN or pattern before the app will open. It is off by default, can be
toggled in Settings, and also hides your records in the app switcher preview. If you
later remove every screen lock from your phone, Cura lets you in rather than locking
you out of your own records.

## Updates

Cura can tell you when a new version is out and install it for you. Open
**Settings → Updates** and tap **Check for updates** to look now: it says so when there
is nothing new. Turn on **Check for updates automatically** there and Cura asks GitHub
at most once a day, and shows you the update as soon as you next open the app. It is
off by default, so until you turn it on, Cura never checks by itself.

The check asks which version is latest and sends none of your records. Like any web
request, it shows GitHub your IP address. That is the only thing it costs.

When there is a newer version, Cura shows what changed. Tap **Update** and it:

1. Downloads the APK from the release, in the background, with a progress
   notification.
2. Checks the file against the SHA-256 GitHub publishes for it, and throws it away if
   a single byte differs.
3. Hands it to Android's installer. The first time, Android asks you to let Cura
   install apps.

Android installs an update only when it is signed with the same key as the Cura
already on your phone, so a file from anyone else is refused. Your records are kept.
**Later** closes the notice, and it comes back the next day.

Versions before 1.4.0 do not have this, so updating to 1.4.0 is done by hand, once.

## Your data stays yours

- **Export** any single record or your entire library as a PDF. Export covers your
  documents; reminders are not included in it.
- **Delete** any record, or wipe everything, from Settings. Deleting a prescription
  also cancels its reminders.
- **See** exactly what is stored, broken down by models, documents, voice model and
  cache, and clear the cache at any time.
- Documents live in the app's private storage. Uninstalling Cura removes them.

## Build it yourself

You need the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install), the Android
SDK, and JDK 17. `flutter doctor` tells you if anything is missing.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tarun-032/Cura.git
cd Cura
flutter pub get
flutter run                  # debug build on a connected phone
```

That is the whole setup. There is no API key to configure, no `.env` file, no backend to
run. A cloud key, if you want one, is entered in the app at runtime and never touches
the repository.

Other useful commands:

```bash
flutter analyze              # static analysis
flutter test                 # unit and widget tests
flutter build apk --release  # the installable APK
```

**Use a real phone, not an emulator.** The AI model is compiled for ARM64, so it will
not load on an x86 emulator. Everything else works there, but nothing AI-related will.

**Signing.** Release builds here are signed with a private key that is not in this
repository. Building from source without it just works: Gradle falls back to your own
debug key automatically, so `flutter build apk --release` needs no extra setup from a
fresh clone. Your build simply carries your signature instead of the official one.

**Code generation.** The database layer is generated. If you change a table in
`lib/core/data/app_database.dart`, regenerate it:

```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

## How the project is organised

Everything lives under `lib/`, split by feature rather than by layer, so one folder
holds the screen, its state and its logic together.

```
lib/
  app/theme/       colours, typography, the Material 3 theme
  core/data/       the SQLite schema and the repositories that read it,
                   documents, chats and reminders
  core/widgets/    small widgets shared across features
  features/
    onboarding/    first run: engine choice, voice, app lock
    scan/          camera, OCR, and the rule-based parsers that read a page
    library/       the records list, search, and a single document's page
    timeline/      the same records in date order
    reminders/     dose times read off a prescription, scheduled on-device
    trends/        one measure across reports, charted and summarised
    ask/           the chat screen and its saved conversations
    ai/            answering questions: retrieval, the local model, and
                   remote/ for the optional cloud engine and its PII filters
    export/        writing records back out as PDF
    pdf_import/    reading a PDF you already have
    security/      the biometric app lock
    settings/      storage, models, engine, and data controls
    updates/       the opt-in GitHub release check, download and install
test/              unit and widget tests, one file per area
```

Two folders carry most of the weight. **`scan/`** is where a photo becomes a record, and
it is deliberately free of AI: OCR reads the text, and rules and table geometry do the
rest. **`ai/remote/`** is the boundary the cloud engine has to cross, and it is where
every piece of personal information is stripped before a request can leave the phone.

**`reminders/`** is model-free for the same reason `scan/` is. Dose times are parsed
from the printed directions by rule, so a reminder can only ever repeat what the
prescription says. **`trends/`** derives its charts from the stored results with no
model either; the only model call in it writes the summary sentences, and every
number in those has to match the readings first.
